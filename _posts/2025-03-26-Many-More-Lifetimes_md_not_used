Happy 36th,

Today feels special — like a festival, because I get to celebrate you. This feeling has been constant in the past, in the dark period and even now. That childlike excitement you carry for this day? Don’t ever lose it. It’s one of the many things that make you… you. Some things — the best things — never change.

Story time…

I once read that life moves in 7-year cycles. That every seven years, the Universe shifts something deep within us. Looking back, your story — our story — paused right at the end of your fourth 7-year cycle. Why? I don’t really know. But maybe, just maybe, it was your time to grow into the woman you were always meant to become — wise, resilient, fiercely loving. And after that fifth cycle… the pages started turning again. And somehow, through a beautifully orchestrated chaos, the Universe brought us back together. I’m so, so grateful it did.

There’s something else I admire deeply in you — your strength to protect your heart, Even if that means chopping off an arm to save the body. That kind of courage? It’s rare. It’s powerful. And I’m endlessly proud of you for it.

A little from my side now…

Around the start of my sixth cycle, something changed in me too. I began seeing the world differently. Became more spiritual. Started believing in the soul — its eternity, its quiet knowing. Why? I’m not sure. Maybe I was preparing to meet you in this lifetime… and wait for you in the next, if need be.

Oh, and I gave up smoking then too. Why? Again — not entirely sure. But I think my soul knew that part of me didn’t belong in the story we were meant to write together.

So on this beautiful day, I just want to say this again, with all my heart — I wish you every joy this world has to offer. You are God’s favorite, I truly believe that. And no matter what the next cycle brings, I’ll be right beside you — through the sunshine and the storms.

Happy birthday! 🎂🎁😘

- Many more lifetimes 😘.
