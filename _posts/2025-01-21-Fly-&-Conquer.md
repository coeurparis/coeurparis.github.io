Hey Champ, read this carefully. Once again, you are graduating from one phase of life into another.

I am so proud of you and feel lucky at the same time. Something is at play, for sure. I am am lucky to be able to see you traverse through this phase of life and grow with it.

It was not only a choice or a decision. What you really did is refuse to accept things as-is and decide to be in control.

I also love how our conversations quickly adapt to the changing situation and how we get behind each other to make sure we are moving in parallel. I hated to be in parallel with someone. Lol. Perpendicular was more my thing (also has a sexual note to it). But, I guess part of growing up, parallel is good. Not ideal, but still optimal. We have and will alway be in sync and grow together.

The fact that you chose hope over fear, is already half the battle won. The other half is only a matter of time and course correction if needed. I almost feel like the dad, who found out that his kid took the first step. The joy is always about the first step, and it is never about the stability or fall after. Feeling very proud of you and I wish I had better words to express how I feel. But go girl, you are super strong.

Lastly, needless to say, but I am right here behind you, watching over you. I won't let you fall!

Fly and conquer ðŸ˜˜.
