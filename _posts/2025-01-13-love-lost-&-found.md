Watch as a concept was something I hated in isolation, specifically in conjunction was with you. It always seemed to work against me. It did not side with me on a single occasion. I hated it in that moment. Everytime you looked at it, I ended up missing you soon after. I don't know if correlation is causation. But it has a deep association in my mind now.

I am scared to gift you a Watch. I have missed you enough and would hate to add one more reason to make me miss you any more than I already have.

But, like life gave us a second chance, I'd like to pay forward. Let this watch is a token of my love. More so coz, I've actually loved it a lot in the days I was guarding it. I gave it my love and time to make it mine. My wingman of sorts. I want it to work in my favor this time around.

With time, as this watch ticks away, my love will steadily compound. It will be a part of your asset, whether you want it or not!

But let this also be a constant reminder of the fact that, irrespective of the situations, constraints or risks, the way I guarded this watch this far, I will guard your interest,  happiness and you forever. You'll find me by your side every time, come what may. Trust me, I'll find a way!

I promise to protect, love, support, cheerlead, and be with the bearer of this watch, forever, whenever.

- love, lost & found
